## 🌟 Key Spiritual Concepts

### **Dharma** (Righteous Duty)
Every choice in KarmaVerse is evaluated against dharmic principles, teaching players to consider duty, righteousness, and moral law in decision-making.

### **Karma** (Action & Consequence)
The game's core mechanic reflects the Hindu understanding that every action has consequences, binding the soul to the cycle of rebirth until liberation is achieved.

### **Samsara** (Cycle of Rebirth)
Players experience multiple lifetimes, with each rebirth influenced by accumulated karma, illustrating the journey toward moksha (liberation).

### **Moksha** (Liberation)
The ultimate goal is spiritual liberation through the transcendence of desire, attachment, and the ego, achieved through various yoga paths.
